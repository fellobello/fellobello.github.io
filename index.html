                    I've always loved math, and it's become a big part of my life.
                    When COVID-19 hit, I took a break from school. During that time, I
                    explored my interest in music and collaborated with other artists. I
                    also enjoy arts and crafting, even though I'm not the best artist.
                    Game development eventually became a creative outlet for me and I
                    began to start coding almost everyday. I first started coding in highschool for my robotics team. Eventually, I found my love for coding again and realized that
                    it was the best way to explore all my interests.
                    Since beginning my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, I have slowly
                    become more and more addicted to everything math and code. There is
                    always something new to learn.

                    I'm from Phoenix, Arizona, and I live with two cats. I'm an INTJ according
                    to the Myers-Briggs test. Exercise is part of my daily routine. My interests
                    are diverse and tend to change frequently.

                    Here's a collection of projects that showcase how I have blended
                    mathematical concepts with programming. I highly suggest checking
                    out my
                    <a href="https://github.com/fellobello">GitHub</a>
                    page as well. These simulations are based
                    on simple mathematical and algorithmic concepts. Ive tried to leave
                    comments in the source code to better explain how our scripts work
                    step by step.

                    I've tried to explore topics here that interest me personally while
                    demonstrating coding fundamentals and my ability to organize
                    code/projects along the way.

                    I currently have the most experience with programming in Java and Python,
                    and I feel fairly confident problem solving with these tools and many of
                    their libraries. I am less knowledgable but still familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript
                    for static web design, C# for Unity scripts, and the basics of x86 Assembly. I
                    have a fairly comprehensive understanding of constructing and utilizing algorithms
                    for time or memory efficient problem solving, mostly with Java due to the stricter controls.
                    I have a solid understanding of Set Theory, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Boolean Algebra,
                    Calculus, Trigonometry, Combinatorics, Vector and Matrix Math, and Number Theory in general.

                <p>
                    Right now, I'm interested in quantum and analogue computing,
                    cellular automata, data analysis, emergent behaviors in
                    dynamic systems, and game theory. In the future, I want to
                    be part of a team. I really love math, and it's hard to find
                    people who share my interests. Ultimately, I want to use my
                    skills to change the world in meaningful ways.
