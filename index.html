        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            I've always loved math, and it's been a big part of my life. In
            college, I started with neuroscience but later realized that coding
            was the best way to explore my interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            When COVID-19 hit, I took a break from school. During that time, I
            explored my interest in music and collaborated with other artists. I
            also enjoy arts and crafting, even though I'm not the best artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm from Tucson, Arizona.

            Here's a collection of projects that showcase how I have blended
            mathematical concepts with programming. These simulations are based
            on simple mathematical and algorithmic concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've tried to explore topics here that interest me personally while
            demonstrating coding fundamentals and my ability to organize
            code/projects along the way.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            In the future, I want to be part of a team. I'm good at math and
            science, and it's hard to find people who share my interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, I'm interested in quantum and analogue computing,
            cellular automata, Python data analysis, and emergent behaviors in
            dynamic systems and game theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I want to use my skills to change the world in
            meaningful ways.
