            Exploring the intersection of mathematics and programming, this
            portfolio captures my journey through various projects that apply
            complex mathematical theories in practical coding scenarios.

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            I've always loved math, and it's been a big part of my life. In
            college, I started with neuroscience but later realized that math
            and coding were my true passions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When COVID-19 hit, I took a break from school. During that time, I
            explored my interest in music and collaborated with other artists. I
            also enjoy art and crafting, even though I'm not the best at visual
            art.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm from Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, and I have two cats that mean
            the world to me.

            Here's a collection of projects that showcase how I have blended
            mathematical concepts with programming. These simulations are based
            on simple mathematical and algorithmic concepts. I've tried to explore
            topics here that interest me personally while demonstrating coding
            fundamentals and my ability to organize code/projects along the way.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            In the future, my main goal is to feel like a valued member of a
            team. I'm good at math and science, but I've often felt alone in my
            interests. It's tough finding people who share my passions and
            abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, my top priority is getting involved in a project where I
            can work with others and make something amazing together. I've
            always been obsessed with math, and currently, I'm really into
            things like quantum and analogue computing, cellular automata, and
            statistical data analysis using Python. I'm also fascinated by
            emergent behaviors in dynamic systems and game theory. I see all
            these interests as connected.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream is to use what I've learned in these areas to help others
            in practical ways. I want to take my knowledge and skills and apply
            them to real-world problems, making a positive impact on the world.
