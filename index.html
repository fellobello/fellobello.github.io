          <p>
            I've always loved math, and it's become a big part of my life.
            When COVID-19 hit, I took a break from school. During that time, I
            explored my interest in music and collaborated with other artists. I
            also enjoy arts and crafting, even though I'm not the best artist. 
            Game development eventually became a creative outlet for me and I 
            began to start coding almost everyday. Eventually, I realized that 
            coding was the best way to explore all my interests and unlock my potential.
            Since beginning my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, I have slowly 
            become more and more addicted to everything math and code. There is 
            always something new to learn.
          </p>

            I'm from Phoenix, Arizona, and I live with two cats. I'm an INTJ according 
            to the Myers-Briggs test. Exercise is part of my daily routine. My interests 
            are diverse and tend to change frequently.

            Here's a collection of projects that showcase how I have blended
            mathematical concepts with programming. I highly suggest checking 
            out my 
            <a href="https://github.com/fellobello">GitHub</a> 
            page as well. These simulations are based
            on simple mathematical and algorithmic concepts. Ive tried to leave
            comments in the source code to better explain how our scripts work 
            step by step.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've tried to explore topics here that interest me personally while
            demonstrating coding fundamentals and my ability to organize
            code/projects along the way.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            I currently have the most experience with programming in Java and Python,
            and I feel fairly confident problem solving with these tools and many of 
            their libraries. I am less knowledgable but still familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript 
            for static web design, C# for Unity scripts, and the basics of x86 Assembly. I 
            have a fairly comprehensive understanding of constructing and utilizing algorithms
            for time or memory efficient problem solving, mostly with Java due to the stricter controls.
            I have a solid understanding of Set Theory, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Boolean Algebra,
            Calculus, Trigonometry, Combinatorics, Vector and Matrix Math, and Number Theory in general. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, I'm interested in quantum and analogue computing,
            cellular automata, data analysis, emergent behaviors in
            dynamic systems, and game theory. In the future, I want to 
            be part of a team. I really love math, and it's hard to find 
            people who share my interests. Ultimately, I want to use my 
            skills to change the world in meaningful ways.
