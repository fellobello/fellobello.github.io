            Exploring the intersection of mathematics and programming, this
            portfolio captures my journey through various projects that apply
            complex mathematical theories in practical coding scenarios.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            In the future, my main goal is to feel like a valued member of a
            team. I'm good at math and science, but I've often felt alone in my
            interests. It's tough finding people who share my passions and
            abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, my top priority is getting involved in a project where I
            can work with others and make something amazing together. I've
            always been obsessed with math, and currently, I'm really into
            things like quantum and analogue computing, cellular automata, and
            statistical data analysis using Python. I'm also fascinated by
            emergent behaviors in dynamic systems and game theory. I see all
            these interests as connected.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream is to use what I've learned in these areas to help others
            in practical ways. I want to take my knowledge and skills and apply
            them to real-world problems, making a positive impact on the world.
