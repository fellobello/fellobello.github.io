        <h3>Project Start and Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
          The project began with the creation of a 3-state cellular automaton,
          quickly confronting the vast number of rule possibilities, in the
          order of 3^2187. Recognizing the impracticality of manual analysis due
          to the predominance of noise, an automated approach was adopted. A
          Java application was developed for mass data collection, simulating
          thousands of rule sets ith a heuristic to discern patterns of
          behavior. Initial data analysis revealed two distinct groups based on
          the stability of patterns, guiding the next steps of the
          investigation.

        <h3>Analysis, Neural Network Integration, and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
          Data encoding and optimization were crucial for making the dataset
          manageable and intelligible for neural network analysis. Following
          data normalization and careful selection of neural network
          architecture tailored to our data features, the network was trained to
          identify rule sets leading to stable structures. Despite efforts,
          creating effective rules based on neural network outputs proved
          challenging due to inherent limitations in capturing specific rule
          restrictions. The network was instead used to evaluate hundreds of
          rule sets, assigning scores to gauge stability. While achieving scores
          above .45 was rare, a significant concentration of scores around 0.8
          was noted in our data anlysis, presenting a targeted but elusive high-score group amidst a
          vast possibility space.
