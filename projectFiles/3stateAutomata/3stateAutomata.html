      <h1>Exploration of 3-State Cellular Automaton</h1>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Project Start and Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
          The project began with the creation of a 3-state cellular automaton,
          quickly confronting the vast number of rule possibilities, in the
          order of 3^2187. Recognizing the impracticality of manual analysis due
          to the predominance of noise, an automated approach was adopted. A
          Java application was developed for mass data collection, simulating
          thousands of rule sets with a heuristic to discern patterns of
          behavior. Initial data analysis revealed two distinct groups based on
          the stability of patterns, guiding the next steps of the
          investigation.

        <p>
          Below are examples of stable structures observed in the simulations,
          showcasing the complexity and beauty of patterns that can emerge from
          simple rules.

        <h3>Analysis, Neural Network Integration, and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
          Data encoding and optimization were crucial for making the dataset
          manageable and intelligible for neural network analysis. Following
          data normalization and careful selection of neural network
          architecture tailored to our data features, the network was trained to
          identify rule sets leading to stable structures. Despite efforts,
          creating effective rules based on neural network outputs proved
          challenging due to inherent limitations in capturing specific rule
          restrictions. The network was instead used to evaluate hundreds of
          rule sets, assigning scores to gauge stability. While achieving scores
          above .45 was rare, a significant concentration of scores around 0.8
          was noted in our data analysis, presenting a targeted but elusive
          high-score group amidst a vast possibility space.

        <h3>Simulation and Exploration on This Page</h3>
        <p>
          The simulation running on this page uses a subset of 100 out of the
          possible 243 rules to avoid overwhelming chaos, allowing for clearer
          observation of emergent patterns. Notably, these simulations are less
          chaotic than those involving over 200 rules, used in our examples,
          which all have over 200 rules. Clicking the "Restart" button
          reinitializes the board with new rules and random states for each
          cell, enabling exploration of the wide array of possibilities within a
          more controlled chaos.
