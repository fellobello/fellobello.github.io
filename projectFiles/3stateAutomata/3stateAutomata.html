                    The project began with the creation of a 3-state cellular automaton,
                    quickly confronting the vast number of rule possibilities, in the
                    order of 3^2187. Recognizing the impracticality of manual analysis due
                    to the predominance of noise, an automated approach was adopted. After
                    developing a way to encode my states and rules into different counting
                    systems (base n where n is the number of states), a Java application
                    was developed for mass data collection, simulating thousands of rule
                    sets with a heuristic to discern patterns of behavior. Initial data
                    analysis revealed two distinct groups based on the stability of
                    patterns, guiding the next steps of the investigation.

                    Below are examples of stable structures observed in the simulations,
                    showcasing the complexity and beauty of patterns that can emerge from
                    simple rules. In the

                    there are more example rule sets.

                    Data encoding and optimization were crucial for making the dataset
                    manageable and intelligible for neural network analysis. Following
                    data normalization and careful selection of neural network
                    architecture tailored to our data features, the network was trained to
                    identify rule sets leading to stable structures. Despite efforts,
                    creating effective rules based on neural network outputs proved
                    challenging due to inherent limitations in capturing specific rule
                    restrictions. The network was instead used to evaluate hundreds of
                    rule sets, assigning scores to gauge stability. While achieving scores
                    above .45 was rare, a significant concentration of scores around 0.8
                    was noted in our data analysis, presenting an elusive high-score group
                    amidst a vast possibility space.

                    The simulation running on this page uses a subset of 100 out of the
                    possible 243 rules to avoid overwhelming chaos, allowing for clearer
                    observation of emergent patterns. Notably, these simulations are less
                    chaotic than those used in our examples, which all have over 200
                    rules. Clicking the "Restart" button reinitializes the board with new
                    rules and random states for each cell, enabling exploration of the
                    wide array of possibilities within a more controlled chaos.
