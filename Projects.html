        <p>
          <strong>Overview:</strong> This variant of Conway's Game of Life
          explores how altering the traditional square grid to a hexagonal one
          affects emergent behaviors. Utilizing p5.js for graphics, this project
          demonstrates the flexibility and complexity of cellular automata.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Successes and Discoveries:</strong> Incorporating a hexagonal
          grid introduced unique challenges but also led to the discovery of
          stable organisms with varying periods (2, 3, 4, and 5). This
          adjustment only required a minor change to neighbor calculation,
          illustrating the robustness of Conway's rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> Adapting Conway's Game of Life to a
          hexagonal grid tested my problem-solving skills, particularly in
          accurately calculating neighbors based on cell position (even or odd
          columns).

        <a href="projectFiles/pathFinder/pathFinder.html">Greedy Path Finder</a>
      </h2>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>
          <strong>Overview:</strong> Using a greedy best-first algorithm with
          Manhattan distance heuristic, this simulation navigates a maze
          generated by Perlin noise to find the shortest path to a goal. It's
          akin to searching in the dark, guided by sound alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Successes and Discoveries:</strong> The project showcases the
          effectiveness of heuristics in pathfinding, creating an engaging
          visual demonstration of the algorithm navigating through dynamically
          generated mazes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> One significant hurdle was dealing with
          scenarios where no path exists due to the maze layout. My ongoing task
          is to develop a preemptive solution to identify and handle such cases
          efficiently.

          >Brownian Motion Simulator</a
        >
      </h2>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>
          <strong>Overview:</strong> This project simulates Brownian motion,
          with one large particle influenced by collisions from numerous
          smaller, less massive particles. The physics involved are mostly
          approximations using mathematical and visual tricks to represent the
          phenomenon accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Successes and Discoveries:</strong> While there weren't any
          groundbreaking discoveries, the project involved significant
          problem-solving, particularly in visualizing the simulation within the
          constraints of the p5.js library. One notable solution was to simplify
          the visualization by rendering only the large particle as a small
          rainbow particle, foregoing rendering the small particles and
          background for efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> Visualizing the simulation proved
          challenging due to the complex interactions and the need for efficient
          rendering. A noteworthy challenge was to accurately represent the
          dynamics of Brownian motion while maintaining performance within the
          framework's limitations. Ongoing efforts include refining the
          visualization and optimizing performance further.
