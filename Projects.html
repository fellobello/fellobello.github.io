          <strong>Overview:</strong> This variant of Conway's Game of Life
          explores how altering the traditional square grid to a hexagonal one
          affects emergent behaviors. Utilizing p5.js for graphics, this project
          demonstrates the flexibility and complexity of cellular automata.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Successes and Discoveries:</strong> Incorporating a hexagonal
          grid introduced unique challenges but also led to the discovery of
          stable organisms with varying periods (2, 3, 4, and 5). This
          adjustment only required a minor change to neighbor calculation,
          illustrating the robustness of Conway's rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> Adapting Conway's Game of Life to a
          hexagonal grid tested my problem-solving skills, particularly in
          accurately calculating neighbors based on cell position (even or odd
          columns).

        <p>
          <strong>Overview:</strong> Using a greedy best-first algorithm with
          Manhattan distance heuristic, this simulation navigates a maze
          generated by Perlin noise to find the shortest path to a goal. It's
          akin to searching in the dark, guided by sound alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Successes and Discoveries:</strong> The project showcases the
          effectiveness of heuristics in pathfinding, creating an engaging
          visual demonstration of the algorithm navigating through dynamically
          generated mazes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> One significant hurdle was dealing with
          scenarios where no path exists due to the maze layout. My ongoing task
          is to develop a preemptive solution to identify and handle such cases
          efficiently.
