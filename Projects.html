          This project adapts Conway's Game of Life to a hexagonal grid,
          offering a twist on the classic by using p5.js. The change to hexagons
          introduces new patterns and behaviors, highlighting the game's
          inherent complexity. The challenge lay in recalculating connections
          between cells, yet the outcome shows how simple rule modifications can
          unveil significant differences. My interest here lies in the game's
          potential for complexity, inspiring thoughts on its application for
          computational solutions.

        <p>
          The project employs a greedy best-first algorithm to navigate mazes,
          chosen for its efficiency in speed versus memory use. This approach
          simulates real-time problem-solving, offering insights into
          algorithmic efficiency and heuristic applications. The balance between
          speed and resource utilization reflects my preference for practical,
          effective solutions in computational tasks. The challenge of
          navigating through mazes in Javascript without guaranteed exits provided 
          valuable lessons in algorithmic adaptation.

          This simulation illustrates Brownian motion, focusing on the
          unpredictable movement of particles. This project was inspired 
          by an interesting video on the topic.
          Despite the technical challenges of accurate representation within the
          p5.js library, the project succeeds in demystifying a straightforward 
          concept through visual demonstration.
